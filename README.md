## vmmap-win-cmd
get process vmmap on windows, just like cat /proc/PID/maps in linux
the src code changed from https://github.com/twpol/vmmap , but I modify the protection str(and not completed yet, so do not pay attention to the protection str)

## usage
> 1. vmmap -pid \<pid>

## install
1. download the release source code, and use vs2017 to compile it into 64bits and 32bits
    + there are vmmap compiled(both 64bits and 32 bits) in the release package
